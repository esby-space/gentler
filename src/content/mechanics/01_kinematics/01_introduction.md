# Vectors and Kinematics

Physics is the fundamental study of matter in the Universe. As a branch of physics, mechanics is concered with the motion of matter, and the tools that we will develop to analyze this motion such as momentum, force, and energy will be useful in almost every area of science.

We'll start by introducing vectors, which we can use to represent the position of an object. Then we'll be able to use these vectors to define velocity and acceleration!
